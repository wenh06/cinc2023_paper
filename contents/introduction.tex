Cardiac arrest (CA), especially out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), is a major worldwide public health issue with a low survival rate \cite{Yan_2020_Global}. CA often results in cerebral lesions, a leading cause of early death for patients resuscitated from it \cite{Benghanem_2022_Prog}. Physicians prognosticate the neurological recovery outcomes for survivors comatose after initial treatments \cite{Cronberg_2020_Brain}, which is a challenging task requiring a minimal false-positive rate of poor outcomes.

With the aim of improving objectivity and accessibility for reliable prognostication after CA, the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2023 \cite{Goldberger2000, 2023Challenge} proposed to develop automated auxiliary prognostic support systems using longitudinal EEG. In this work, a novel approach providing qualitative neurological interpretations and predictions is presented.
