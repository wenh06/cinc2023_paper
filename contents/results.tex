% The primary Challenge Score, which is the largest TPR such that FPR $\le 0.05$ evaluated on the hidden validation set up to 72 hours from ROSC, of our team ``Revenger'' was 0.701. Auxiliary scores evaluated on its truncated 12h / 24h / 48h subsets and scores on the training and cross-validation sets during the offline development of our solution are gathered in Table \ref{tab:challenge_scores}.

% It should be noted that the training and cross-validation data were de-identified, in which case different 180s data pieces were considered from different patients. This explains the lowered scores on these data subsets.

The primary Challenge Score, the largest TPR such that FPR $\le 0.05$ evaluated on the hidden test set up to 72 hours from ROSC, of our team ``Revenger'' was 0.554, ranked 13th out of 36 teams. This score and auxiliary scores from the truncated subsets of 48h / 24h / 12h from ROSC and the training and hidden validation sets are gathered in Table \ref{tab:final_results}.

 % Despite the Challenge Score, our solution achieved remarkable results on MAE of CPC score predictions. We also include them in Table \ref{tab:final_results}.

 Despite the Challenge Score, our solution achieved remarkable results on MAE of CPC score predictions, which is the learning target of our solution. CPC MAE was 1.014 on the hidden test set, ranked 4th out of 36 teams. Corresponding CPC MAE results were 0.957, 1.111, and 1.347 on the truncated subsets of 48h / 24h / 12h from ROSC.\footnote{Refer to \url{https://github.com/DeepPSP/cinc2023/blob/master/images/Revenger-team-digest.pdf} for a full summary table of all metrics and rankings of our team.}
