% The primary Challenge Score, which is the largest TPR such that FPR $\le 0.05$ evaluated on the hidden validation set up to 72 hours from ROSC, of our team ``Revenger'' was 0.701. Auxiliary scores evaluated on its truncated 12h / 24h / 48h subsets and scores on the training and cross-validation sets during the offline development of our solution are gathered in Table \ref{tab:challenge_scores}.

% It should be noted that the training and cross-validation data were de-identified, in which case different 180s data pieces were considered from different patients. This explains the lowered scores on these data subsets.

The primary Challenge Score, the largest TPR such that FPR $\le 0.05$ evaluated on the hidden test set up to 72 hours from ROSC, of our team ``Revenger'' was 0.554, ranked 12th out of 35 teams. This score and auxiliary scores evaluated on the truncated 48h / 24h / 12h subsets and on the training and hidden validation sets are gathered in Table \ref{tab:final_results}.

 Despite the Challenge Score, our solution achieved a remarkable result on MAE of CPC score predictions. We also include it in Table \ref{tab:final_results}.
