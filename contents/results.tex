The primary Challenge Score, the largest TPR such that FPR $\le 0.05$ evaluated on the hidden validation set up to 72 hours from ROSC, of our team ``Revenger'' was 0.701. Auxiliary scores evaluated on the truncated subsets and on the training and cross-validation sets during the offline development of our solution are gathered in Table \ref{tab:challenge_scores}.
