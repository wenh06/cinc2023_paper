\caption{Primary hyperparameters for NN model training. To avoid overfitting on the training data, early stop callbacks were set which were triggered if the best Challenge score on the left-out validation set stayed unchanged for 25 global iterations. The learning rates were set for the optimizer and its scheduler.}
